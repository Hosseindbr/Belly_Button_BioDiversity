* Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, JSON and IO (Web Server)

* Software:  Visual Studio Code, ES6, D3, Javascript, HTML, CSS.


## Summary

ii. Select a volunteer's id from the drop-down menu to begin the analysis.

iii. Upon selecting this id, the bar chart will be updated and show data from the top ten bacteria cultures. 

iv. Washing frequency is represented by a gauge chart, indicating how many scrubs are done per week. 

v. On the bubble chart, bubble size indicates the amount and diversity of bacteria in the sample.
